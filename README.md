# Middleman4 + Webpack template

This repo is structured as a Middleman Template.

It contains [plenty of rich features every website should have](./FEATURES.md), such as:

- Performance improvements
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Opengraph configuration

If you've never used a template to initialise a Middleman project, head over to [middlemanapp.com/…/project-templates](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/project-templates/) to find out how to they work.

## Setup

### Install Middleman

First, get [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) installed.

```
gem install middleman
```

### Initialise from this project template

Then in your parent directory…

```
middleman init PROJECT_NAME -T Well-FED/middleman-website-template
```

Middleman will then use this repo as your new project template.

### Installing further dependencies

Change to your new project directory…

```
cd PROJECT_NAME
```

…and follow the installation instructions inside the new `README`
